In the last exercise, you introduced an intermediate decision with the
purpose to decompose a huge decision table into smaller parts. This is
only effective if the intermediate decision breaks some dependencies
between input data nodes and the final decision. In the example, it
has been assumed that the sensor format breaks the dependencies
between level, budget, and subject on the one hand and the camera
model on the other hand. Now assume that camera `m1` is recommended if
the weight limit is `250g`, no tilt screen is desired, the level is
beginner, the subject is portrait, and the budget is 1000. Now the
budget will be increased to 2000. This will change:

1. [The sensor format](../../step4/quiz/answerSensor.md)
1. [The weight limit](../../step4/quiz/answerWeight.md)
1. [None of the decisions](../../step4/quiz/answerNone.md)
1. [The camera model](../../step4/quiz/answerCamera.md)
1. [All of the decisions](../../step4/quiz/answerAll.md)
