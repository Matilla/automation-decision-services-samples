### Making an individual decision

Decision making, in the traditional sense, consists in making a choice
between given alternatives. For example, a customer may want to buy a
camera that takes better photos than a smartphone. There is a large
variety of camera systems differing in form factor and other
characteristics. Most modern camera systems are mirrorless and there
are many different mirrorless systems covering the needs of all kinds
of photographers whether they are beginners, advanced photographers, or
professionals. These systems differ in their sensor types and it will
be important to choose among Micro Four-Thirds cameras, APS-C
cameras, and full-frame cameras.

The difficulty then is to find out
which alternative is best suited for the customer. The customer may ask the help of
an advisor in order to evaluate and compare the alternatives according to
different criteria. For example, the sensor formats differ in crop factor, 
camera size, low-light performance and the customer may have preferences about the respective values. 
There are sophisticated decision-aiding methods that assess and aggregate those preferences
in a consistent way. In the end, they result
into a ranking of the given alternatives. For example, the customer may prefer a
full-frame camera to an APS-C camera and an APS-C camera to a
Micro Four-Thirds camera.

In ADS, it is possible to introduce a decision node requiring the choice of one of the
three alternatives, but ADS does not provide any direct means to evaluate these alternatives in order 
to determine a ranking among them. Moreover, ADS has no built-in mechanism to choose the best decision according to
an arbitrary ranking. However, the ranking may help us to craft the decision logic in ADS, 
which will be shown in the next step. We included this first step to explain the difference 
and relationship between traditional decision making and the kind of decision making supported
by ADS.

#### Exercise

Choose your own personal ranking of the three options

 - full-frame format
 - APS-C format
 - Micro Four-Thirds format
 
It will be used to determine the decisions in the [next step](../step2/description.md).
 
#### Limitations

This approach above is well-suited for individual decisions where each
of the given alternatives can be chosen in each case. The [next step](../step2/description.md)
will examine what happens if the available alternatives depend on the
given case.
